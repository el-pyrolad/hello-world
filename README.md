This is my very own first repo!

I feel like a fish that now swims freely in the ocean; a fish that is no longer confined to man-made aquaria!

Freedom, however, comes at a cost. This fish can no longer expect to be fed in the wild, for its freedom allows it to be independent in all its endeavors, including the feat of merely surving to swim another day.
